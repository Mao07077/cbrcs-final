  title: "Song Title",
  artist: "Artist Name",
  url: "https://source-url.com",
  duration: "3:45",
  thumbnail: "https://thumbnail-url.com",
  source: "youtube" | "custom" | "embedded"
}
```

### Playlist Object
```javascript
{
  _id: "playlist_id",
  user_id: "user_id",
  name: "Playlist Name",
  description: "Optional description",
  is_public: true,

}
```

## Installation & Setup

1. **Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi pydantic pymongo
   ```

2. **Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install lucide-react zustand
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - MongoDB collections: `playlists`, `user_playlists`
   - Ensure proper indexes for user_id and playlist queries

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Update your MongoDB connection string
   - Ensure CORS settings allow frontend requests

## Customization

### Adding New Sources
To support additional music sources, extend the `extract_youtube_info` function in `music_routes.py`:

```python
def extract_source_info(url: str, source_type: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    if source_type == "spotify":
        # Implement Spotify URL parsing
        pass
    elif source_type == "soundcloud":
        # Implement SoundCloud URL parsing
        pass
    # ... additional sources
```

### Styling
The components use Tailwind CSS classes. Customize the appearance by modifying the className attributes in each component.

### Store Extensions
Extend the `musicPlayerStore` to add features like:
- Shuffle and repeat modes
- Equalizer settings
- Playback history
- Favorites management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Audio not playing**: Check CORS settings and audio URL accessibility
2. **YouTube videos not loading**: Implement YouTube Player API for embedded playback
3. **Playlist not saving**: Verify user authentication and database permissions
4. **Controls not responding**: Check audio element initialization in the store
5. **Features not showing**: Ensure you're accessing `/student/music-player` route and that `StudyMusicPlayerPage.jsx` imports `EnhancedMusicPlayer`
